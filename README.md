## 📁 Project 1: Customer Churn Analysis for Telecom Industry

### 🔍 Objective
Identify key factors that lead to customer churn and develop predictive insights to reduce churn in a telecom company.

### 📂 Dataset
- Source: Kaggle (Telco Customer Churn Dataset)
- Size: ~7,000 customer records
- Features: Customer demographics, services used, tenure, billing info, churn status

### 🔧 Tools & Libraries
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebook

### 🧪 Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning** – Removed nulls, converted data types
2. **EDA** – Correlation, churn distributions, categorical variable impact
3. **Feature Engineering** – One-hot encoding, binning
4. **Model Building** – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
5. **Evaluation** – Accuracy, ROC-AUC, classification report

### 📊 Insights
- Tenure, contract type, and monthly charges are strong churn indicators.
- Customers on month-to-month plans churn more.
- Predictive model achieved ~85% accuracy.

### 📎 Deliverables
- Final Jupyter Notebook
- Presentation Slide Deck
- PDF Report

## 📁 Project 2: E-commerce Return Rate Reduction Analysis

### 🔍 Objective
Understand the key reasons behind product returns and develop data-backed strategies to reduce return rates in an online marketplace.

### 📂 Dataset
- Source: Olist (Brazilian E-commerce)
- Merged from 9 CSV files (e.g., orders, products, payments, reviews, customers)
- Final merged dataset: `ecommerce_return_dataset.csv`

### 🧰 Tools & Tech
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib)
- Power BI (Interactive dashboards)

### 🔬 Key Steps
1. **Data Merging** – Joined all relevant CSVs into one comprehensive dataset
2. **Cleaning** – Handled null values, filtered relevant columns
3. **EDA in Python** – Identified patterns in returns by product, region, review score
4. **Power BI Dashboard**  
   - KPIs: Total Orders, Returns, Return Rate (%)  
   - Visuals:
     - Returns by Review Score (combo chart)
     - Returns by Payment Type
     - Returns by Product Category
     - Return Rate by Region
     - Slicers: Product Category, Customer State, Payment Type
   - Pages:  
     - Page 1: Overview  
     - Page 2: Regional Insights  

### 📊 Insights
- Products with low review scores have higher return rates.
- Certain states show disproportionate returns.
- "Boleto" payment method had slightly lower returns.

### 📎 Deliverables
- Python Notebook (EDA)
- Power BI Dashboard
- Summary Report
